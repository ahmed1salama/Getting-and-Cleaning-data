** CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

** run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required:
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set**
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement**
* label the data set with descriptive variable names
* create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
